How to use the number guessing game

Objective of the Game: 
- The computer will pick a number at random between 1 and 100.
- Your goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.

Playing the Game:
- Make Your Guess: Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input box.
- Submit Your Guess: Either click on the “Guess” button or just press Enter.
- Get Some Feedback:
  - If your guess is correct, you will see a message that says “Congratulations!” and the game will end and let you know your score.
  - If the guess is too low, you will be prompted to try a higher number.
  - If the guess is too high, you should try a lower number.
- Keep Track of Attempts: You will see the number of attempts you have made right below the input box.
- Hints:
  - After 3 attempts you will receive a hint (like if the number is even or odd).
  - If you have guessed before the hint will also indicate if you are getting “warmer” (closer) or “colder” (farther).

Scoring:
- Once you guess the number, a score will be calculated based on how many attempts you needed to guess the number:
  - Score = 100 - (attempts - 1) x 5; minimum score is 0.
  - The smaller the number of attempts = the higher score.

Restart:
- If you want to play again, just refresh the browser page to generate another random number.

Tips:
- Enter only numbers between 1 and 100. Invalid inputs will prompt an error message.
- Use the hints to narrow down your guesses.
- Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible to maximize your score!
